Acquire, store, retrieve -> Explore -> Clean -> Analyze -> Visualize

## core data representation (CDR)

design pattern for structuring flexible and reusable data pipelines

- stages of the I/O pipeline communicate through CDR
- modular with no hard dependencies on one another
- allows for rearrangement and clean scalability
- support multiple file formats by wiring together modular import and export code

## acquire store retrieve
*see acquire-store-retrieve/exercises and acquire-store-retrieve/toolkit for importing and exporting data from/to text file formats and databases*
